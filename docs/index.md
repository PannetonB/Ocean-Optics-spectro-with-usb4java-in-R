A small project to show how to use usb4java library to communicate directly to an Ocean Optics spectrometer without the OmniDriver library.

The full documentation is available at [full documentation](OO_USB4000_w_usb4java_in_R.html).

The project is hosted on my GitHub at https://github.com/PannetonB/Ocean-Optics-spectro-with-usb4java-in-R
